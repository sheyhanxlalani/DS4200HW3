<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>My name is Sheyhan, and I train at Peter Welch's Gym in Boston, a place known for its strong boxing community and great coaching. Boxing has become a huge part of my life, and I’ve found that it challenges me both physically and mentally. It’s a sport that requires discipline, endurance, and focus—qualities that I try to build on every time I step into the ring.
    One of the key influences in my boxing journey is the legendary Muhammad Ali. His speed, skill, and confidence made him one of the greatest boxers of all time, but it’s his courage and determination outside the ring that inspire me the most. Ali stood for more than just boxing; he was a symbol of resilience, standing up for what he believed in, even when it wasn’t easy.
    Through this site, I hope to share my passion for boxing, provide updates on my progress, and celebrate the sport that has had such a big impact on my life. Whether you’re a fan or just curious about the sport, I’m excited to share my passion with you!</p>
